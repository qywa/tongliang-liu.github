<p>Statistical learning theory provides the mathematical and theoretical foundations for statistical learning algorithms and inspires the development of more efficient methods. We are interested in how to measure the complexity of the algorithmic hypothesis class, which is a subset of the predefined hypothesis class that a learning algorithm will (or is likely to) output. Finding such a small subset will give us insights on explaining how learning algorithms work.</p>

<p>We assume that the true labels of examples flip into the corrupted labels with some probabilities, with which the true labels can be inferred from the noisy ones.</p>
