      Greetings! I am currently a Lecturer with the School of Computer Science at The University of Sydney. Before joining USyd, I was a Lecturer with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney.
      </p>
      <p>
      My research interests lie in providing mathematical and theoretical foundations to justify and understand machine learning models and designing efficient learning algorithms for problems in computer vision and data mining, with a particular emphasis on matrix factorisation, transfer learning, and learning with label noise.

      </p>
      <p>
      I am always looking for highly-motivated students to join our group. If you are interested in the research in our group, please send an email to tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au about your interests and background (attaching your CV, transcripts, and any previous research papers). Thanks!
