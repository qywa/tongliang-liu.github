      <p>
      </p>
      Greetings! I am currently a Lecturer with the School of Computer Science at The University of Sydney. I received the PhD degree from the University of Technology Sydney and the BE degree from the University of Science and Technology of China. Before joining USyd, I was a Lecturer with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and the School of Software at the University of Technology Sydney.<br>
      <p>
      </p>
       My research interests lie in providing mathematical and theoretical foundations to justify and further understand machine learning models and designing efficient learning algorithms for problems in computer vision and data mining, with a particular emphasis on matrix factorisation, transfer learning, multi-task learning, and learning with label noise. <br>
       <p>
       </p>
       I am always looking for highly-motivated Mphil/MSc and PhD students to join our group. 
       If you are interested in the research in our group, please send an email to tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au about your interests and background (attaching your CV, transcripts, and any previous research papers). Thanks! <br>
